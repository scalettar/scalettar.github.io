            <p id="infoBox">Last week you received a mysterious message inviting you to a board game night. Against your better judgement you decided to attend. However, when you arrived your host was nowhere to be found! To make matters worse, as you walk into the game room the door slams shut behind you. You're trapped! As you take in your surroundings you notice a letter on the table.</p>
